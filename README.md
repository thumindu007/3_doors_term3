## The Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle inspired by a game show scenario. You're given three closed doors, one hiding a valuable prize and the others revealing less desirable items. After choosing a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors, showing a non-prize item. You then decide whether to stick with your initial choice or switch. Surprisingly, switching increases your chances of winning, challenging our intuition about probability.
