- Understude the 3 doors problem and what the best opption is
- best opption is to always switch as you are most likly to pick the the goat at first since its a 2/3
- then when you get shown one of the other doors you didnt pick is a goat and the money is eather at the one you pick or the other one,
- you should always switch as 2/3 times the other one you didnt pick is the money as picking the money first time is 1/3
